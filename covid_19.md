## COVID-19 Documentation

It was impossible to meet as a group due to the COVID-19 outbreak which slowed work on the project significantly. Communication was very difficult which lead to it being very poor as we were unable to meet in person making it much harder to get ideas across. Managing the project as a whole became very difficult however all of this was expected. For example, both the front-end and back-end should be developed synchronously, however with different members of the group working on different aspects of the program it made it much harder to collaborate. The back-end had been finished when the front-end had barely been started. This lead to Jason having to create some simple HTML/CSS in order to check the back-end was correctly linked to the front-end.

For the development of the back-end Jinhyun Jason Park and Sungjin Kang frequently contacted each other via Facebook messenger, phone calls, and Whatsapp. This enabled us to develop/test various features of the application and rectify any code that wasn't working as intended. The whole team were in contact through these methods as well to manage the project schedule and try to keep everythying running as smoothly as possible.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak we have also been unable to contact our client. This has lead to delays in development as we had questions left unanswered and were unable to perform any in person testing of the UI etc.

Some of our questions included:
* If we could change the design of the system due to a table mapping problem in the back-end.
* If we could change the way we managed members and locations as we believed we had found a better way.
* Whether we could focus more on specific requirements than others as some of the original requirements were no longer important to the project.

After waiting for a response from our client with multiple emails for two weeks we decided to make those changes anyway.

This COVID-19 outbreak has definitely affected our ability to work together as a team and has also delayed work on the project.
