\section{Overview}
The School of Computer Science, Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Engineering Maths offers undergraduate, postgraduate taught and postgraduate research degrees. The school provides opportunities to make an impact through creating technology that changes our world. Their strengths in connectivity, computation, AI, cybersecurity, interaction, vision, robotics, energy management, and simulation equip their graduates to create solutions to challenges in health, sustainability, and urban life. The inclusive community is a space for co-creation of education and research. Staff and PhD students are allocated offices or desks for the duration of their employment or studies across four main buildings based on their research interests.
\bigskip

With a number of recent office moves and ongoing renovations, and very limited space it is necessary to know which offices and desks are vacant so that new students and staff can be allocated to appropriate available space. This is currently managed via a space spreadsheet, but this lacks information, for example regarding which research group students or staff are members of, and which spaces are suitable for (or limited to) which research group or department. The space spreadsheet is also difficult to navigate and sometimes very hard to get your head around. This results in members of staff wasting time when updating the spreadsheet and sometimes making mistakes.
\bigskip

The project goal for us is to establish a system that allows dynamic location-allocation for the members who work in this university, being mainly professors, lecturers, and PhD students. Our team will focus on developing a dynamic website application in order to improve from the previous static Excel spreadsheet used by the school.
\bigskip

We aim to keep the web application easy to use, whilst also providing good features, allowing staff to register locations and members for the system. We want to provide a way in which a members details can be visualised quickly and easily, allowing the school to find out information in a much shorter time frame than before. We want the same to be true for the locations used by the school around the university. There will need to be a way to assign members to locations including an end date for that allocation so that space can be freed up once the member has finished working there.
\bigskip

Hopefully the product we create can be used for the foreseeable future by the school, making the task of keeping the information up to date much easier and allowing staff to spend more time on other pieces of work.
